      <h1>SIGDS Schedule 2</h1>
      <h2>Web Design</h2>
      <p class="center">This hands-on course teaches designers how to conceive, prototype and program websites. In order to better understand the possibilities and constraints of browser-based design, participants of this course learn how to build websites for a variety of digital devices. After several short exercises, students design and hand-code a static portfolio website. Participants leave with a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and jQuery, as well as improved Web imaging skills, a heightened understanding of Web-based typography, and a more critical eye for design. Special emphasis is placed on user experience (UX), user interface (UI) design, information architecture and interaction design. Although the exercises and final project use static content, the course introduces the latest versions of open-source content management systems. This course is open to designers of all levels, and has plenty of opportunities for intermediate and advanced students to build upon previous experience.</p>
